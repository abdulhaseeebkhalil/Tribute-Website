            Edhi's charitable activities expanded greatly in 1957 when an Asian
            flu epidemic originating in China swept through Pakistan and the
            rest of the world. Donations allowed him to buy his first ambulance
            the same year. He later expanded his charity network with the help
            of his wife Bilquis Edhi.[11][12] Following his death, his son
            Faisal Edhi took over as head of the Edhi Foundation. Over his
            lifetime, the Edhi Foundation expanded, backed entirely by private
            donations from Pakistani citizens across class, which included
            establishing a network of 1,800 ambulances. By the time of his
            death, Edhi was registered as a parent or guardian of nearly 20,000
            adopted children.[7] He is known amongst Pakistanis as the "Angel of
            Mercy" and is considered to be Pakistan's most respected and
            legendary figure.[3][13] In 2013, The Huffington Post claimed that
            he might be "the world's greatest living humanitarian".[14]
